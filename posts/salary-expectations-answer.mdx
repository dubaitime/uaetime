It can be hard to talk about your salary expectations in a [job walk-in interview](https://uaemoney.ae/post/dubai-walk-in-interview-february-2025/), particularly when you’re a fresh graduate looking to start working in the UAE. The good news is that with the proper preparation, and the right approach, you can feel confident answering this question and impressing potential employers.

## What is the Average Salary for Freshers in the UAE?
The average salary of a fresher in the UAE differs from one industry to another, from one role to another, and from location to location. Entry-level salaries are usually listed between AED 5,000 and AED 15,000 per month.

In terms of additional benefits:

- **Accommodation**: Direct housing is not offered by many employers but an accommodation allowance is.
- **Transportation**: Usually, it comes from the employee, but in some companies, they are part of the package.

Considering the cost of living in cities such as Dubai and Abu Dhabi is very high, it is important to go through the compensation package in detail. Having health insurance, annual leave, and performance bonuses can easily double your salary.

## Why Do Employers Ask About Salary Expectations?

Employers ask about salary expectations to understand:

1. **Budget Alignment**: Their budget should be able to fit your expectations.
2. **Market Awareness**: Determining if you are up to date on industry standards.
3. **Negotiation Skills**: Assessing your capacity to talk about compensation in a professional manner.
4. **Self-Worth**: Gauging how you value your skills and potential.
5. **Cultural Fit**: Understanding if your expectations align with long-term career opportunities.

## How to Prepare for the Salary Question
How to answer the salary question in an interview? The answer is here in just one word: **Preparation**. Follow these steps:

1. **Research Market Standards**: Resources like Glassdoor, PayScale, and LinkedIn enable you to determine salary ranges for entry-level roles in your industry or for roles in your emirate (although this won’t encompass the ongoing BUC diversity project, so you might need to cast your net wider if you do apply!).
2. **Understand Your Value**: Think about what you are good at, what you’ve learned, and what makes you special.
3. **Practice Your Response**: Practice your answer until you sound confident and natural, while being able to keep it flexible and on the go.
4. **Consider the Full Package**: Think beyond the basic salary and include allowances, insurance, and growth opportunities as other benefits.

## Crafting the Perfect Answer
Here are strategies to structure your response effectively:

### 1. Show Flexibility
Don’t quote a fixed amount and say you are open to negotiation.

**Example**: “I’m excited to have an opportunity to contribute to your company. Since I’m a fresher, I’m open to discussing a salary that aligns with industry standards and reflects the value I can provide in this role.”

### 2. Provide a Range (If Insisted)
Give a well-researched range to demonstrate that you are informed and able to adjust.

**Example**: “In my opinion, the salary should be AED 5,000 to 7,000. These are the figures I found in the market. However, I’m more interested in the chance to develop and support your team.”

### 3. Turn the Question Around
Ask if you’re unsure what the company’s budget range is.

**Example**: “I’d like to know a little bit more about what the responsibilities are before discussing a specific number. What budget range do you have in mind for this position?”

## What to Avoid
1. **Being Unprepared**: Quoting unrealistic figures indicates no research has been done.
2. **Providing a Fixed Number**: It limits your flexibility during negotiations.
3. **Undervaluing Yourself**: Asking for too little makes you look as though you don’t know your worth.
4. **Focusing Solely on Salary**: Demonstrate interest in the job and the company.

## Additional Tips for Freshers
1. **Focus on Learning Opportunities**: Highlight your eagerness to grow and develop skills.
2. **Ask About Benefits**: Inquire about allowances, insurance, and other perks to understand the full offer.
3. **Be Positive and Professional**: Speak confidently but remain humble during the discussion.

## Sample Answers for Freshers
1. **General Answer**: “I’m excited to join your team and learn as much as I can. I’m open to discussing a salary comparable to industry standards for this role and aligned with the responsibilities.”
2. **With a Range**: “According to my research, the salary for someone starting in this field ranges from AED 5,000 to AED 7,000. I’m open to negotiation and eager to be part of the team.”
3. **Defer the Discussion**: “Salary expectations can be discussed once I understand the responsibilities and how I can contribute to the company. What range is typical for this position?”
