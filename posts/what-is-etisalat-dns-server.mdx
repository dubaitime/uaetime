Your DNS server settings can be the source of your internet speed problems and website browsing difficulties if you have experienced them. Users in the UAE who connect through internet service provider Etisalat depend on its default DNS server system.

The DNS server stands as a fundamental component to understand since it influences your connection to the internet. This article examines Etisalat's DNS servers together with their performance evaluation and possible alternative server options.

## Understanding DNS Servers

A DNS server serves as an internet phonebook through its Domain Name System functionality. DNS servers transform accessible domain names (such as reddit.com) into the digital network addresses that computers understand. The DNS system enables you to use text-based website addresses instead of memorizing numerical IP addresses because it translates domains into addresses.

The speed of your internet connection heavily depends on DNS servers performing their functions. Your device requires a DNS server connection to transform domain names into IP addresses before starting the website communication process. DNS resolution time represents the span of time required for DNS servers to complete their address conversion process that affects your browsing speed.

## Etisalat’s DNS Servers

Etisalat maintains two primary DNS servers throughout the UAE as one of its major Internet service providers:

- 213.42.20.20
- 195.229.241.222

Many Etisalat network users access domain resolution through default DNS servers which are preinstalled on most routers. Etisalat DNS servers maintain reliable performance but users may achieve better speed by using third-party DNS providers based on their network position and geographic location.

## Performance of Etisalat's DNS Servers

Multiple users conducted DNS server performance tests of Etisalat’s servers through the use of dnsperftest tools that determine DNS server response times. The DNS servers operated by Etisalat deliver quick response times according to testing conducted in UAE territory while surpassing numerous well-known third-party DNS providers.

A user conducted DNS resolution performance checks of Etisalat’s two servers and reported the following results in milliseconds (ms):

- **Etisalat DNS Server 1 (213.42.20.20):** 10.80 ms
- **Etisalat DNS Server 2 (195.229.241.222):** 10.60 ms

The average response times recorded for other DNS servers matched the following results:

- **Google DNS (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4):** 28.20 ms
- **Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1):** 17.90 ms
- **Level3 DNS:** 123.70 ms

The data indicates that Etisalat’s DNS servers provide quick responses averaging less than 15 milliseconds which stands as a great performance level for local Internet Service Provider (ISP) DNS services. Etisalat DNS servers compete at the same speed level as Google and Cloudflare service providers.

## Advantages of Using Etisalat DNS Servers
